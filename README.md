# Crystal-Rectifier-Fudge-Together-using-Feature-Selection-Technique

ABSTRACT:

      Crystal rectifier fudge together is one of the most technologically and highly complicated manufacturing process.This idea automatically generate an acuurate predictive model to predict equipment faults during the fabrication process and it also aims at constructing a decision model to help detecting as quickly as possible any equipment faults in order to maintain high process yields.
      
      
INTRODUCTION:

      The crystal rectifier industry is one of the most technology-evolving and capital-intensive market sectors.Effective prediction of fault detection in equipment is necessary to prevent abrupt equipment breaking down and is also benefit to improve productivity,reduce cost and repairing time.Machine Learning is the engineering of methods that enable computers to adapt their behaviour based on empirical data.It analyzes data and uses the theory of statistics to predict events in the future.The production state and equipment state data provide and oppurtunity for efficient control and optimization.The measured data are so overwhelming that timely detection of any fault during the process is difficult.This idea aims at solving the problem of equipment fault during the fabrication process.


PROBLEM DEFINITION:

       Crystal rectifier industry statistics shows that most equipment suffers atleast 8% unscheduled down time and loss another 7% scheduled maintanence.Maximising process tool uptime has remained a core challenge for the manufacturing over time.Predictive maintanence is the process is discovering when equipment needed maintanence inorder to avoid a catastrophic failure.The process involves collecting and preprocessing the raw data and classification.
